                description: The older_than_token string's structure is still unknown to me. It's being used to page through results. The first part of it seems to be some kind of timestamp. Starting with the current time you'd get the last token of the result set, which in turn could be used to fetch more results.
                example: '1504691191:1603563167:a::'
              count:
                type: integer
                example: 40
