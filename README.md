# Bandcamp-API
My attempt at documenting the un-documented [Bandcamp.com](https://bandcamp.com) web API. Unfortunately they even removed documentation for the previously documented endpoints. [Today's devs pages](https://bandcamp.com/developer) only cover high level APIs, none dealing with the actual content.

The API definition is stored as JSON and YAML files in [Open API v3.0 format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md) in the `data` folder. Use eg. the [swagger.io editor](https://editor.swagger.io) to import and edit, or other [swagger.io tools](https://swagger.io) to process the files.

Check out the [interactive API documentation](https://michaelherger.github.io/Bandcamp-API/).
